      <h3>Important Notice</h3>
      <h4>
        We will be shutting down the LingSync <a href="http://app.lingsync.org">app</a> on August 1st, 2017, after which time corpora will available as archive only.
      </h4>
      <p>Since we changed hosting companies on February 2015 methods classes have notified us of many problems in the LingSync app and we do not recommend using LingSync for future classes.</p>

      <p>We discourage new user registration and new corpus creation on the app, and that we are no longer adding new featurs or fixing bugs. If you were planning on using LingSync for your classes next semester, please <a href="#/contact">contact us</a> for instructions on how to use Dative.</p>

      <p>Please share this message with any others you know who might have been planning on using LingSync for their classes.</p>

      <p>We thank you for the valuable input many of you have provided, and apologize for inconveniences you may have experienced. Please <a href="#/contact">contact us</a> if you have any questions or need any help. LingSync is 100% Open Source, free, non-proprietary and run by volunteers, thanks to over 50 people who have helped build LingSync over the years!</p>
