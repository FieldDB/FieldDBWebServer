    <h3>Warning</h3>
    <h4>We will be shutting down LingSync.org on August 1, 2017, after which time corpora will be read-only.</h4>
    <p>2015 Fall semester field methods classes have notified us of many problems in LingSync and we do not recommend using LingSync for future classes.  
    <p> If you already have an account and corpora on LingSync, you still have access to your existing data until August 1, 2017 (after which time the corpora will be read-only). Please note, however, that we have disabled new user registration and new corpus creation on the app. </p>

	<p>If you were planning on using LingSync for your classes next semester, please email <a href="mailto:info@lingsync.org">info@lingsync.org</a> for instructions on how to use Dative.</p>



<!--     <p>Due to this situation, we have changed the app so that </P>
    <ul>
    	<li>Users can no longer create new accounts. </li>
    	<li>Users can no longer create new corpora. </li>
    </ul>

<p>We are not planning to shut down the Spreadsheet app:  </p>
